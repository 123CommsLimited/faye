Soapbox -- a Twitter-style chat app
===================================

-- Running the demo

  * `sudo gem install sinatra`
  * Run `rackup config.ru` in this directory
  * Open some browsers at http://localhost:9292

Within the app, pick a username, type in some users to follow, and
enter messages. You receive messages from anyone you're following,
and any messages that mention you using the `@username` syntax.

-- Source code

There is no server-side logic for this app; the Faye server simply
handles message routing between clients. Your username and followees
are not persisted, if you refresh the page your previous connection
is closed.

  * See public/soapbox.js
